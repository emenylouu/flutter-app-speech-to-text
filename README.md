# flutter-app-speech-to-text
#stt plugin.

A new Flutter project that has a static list of questions. using speech-to-text recognition plugin you can record your answer. 

* what's available: 
  - speech to text recognition plugin works offline.
  - allows the application to listen to what you're saying while displaying it in text on the same screen.

* what's in progress:

  - save the displayed text(answer)on firebase db /or locally.
  - retreive data from firebase and update it directry.
  
* NOTE: 
- The app runs on a real android device only because of some plugin issues probably.
- Due to the issue with the stt plugin mentioned in the documentation [https://pub.dev/packages/speech_to_text]:speech-to-textÂ . I will be using that method to record.
